USPS Atlanta RPDC Flywheel (21286-) status report 1/1/2023,summary,"Job: 21286-, Month: January 2023, executive summary: On 1/11/23 we submitted our revised baseline estimate budget that increased our contract value from $77.9 to $82.5 million.  Our contract amount was already at $82.9 million since USPS added $5 million contingency so we could keep moving forward due to OSL changes by USPS.  Per our narrative to USPS we used up that $4.5 of the $5 million contingency due to quotes coming in hire than our budget, design changes based on feedback from USPS on our 100% design and our budget for sales tax was well under.  USPS verbally has accepted our revised baseline of $82.5 million.  On 1/9/23 we submitted our PCO 2 change order for $11.8 million.  This has extend our contract duration by 4 months based on electrical lead-times, which we are trying to improve on.  At this time, Phase 2 would not be completed until 12/4/23.  Original Phase 2 completion was 8/4/23., potential risk: We have had some delay on electrical material.  Some of those delays have been two months.  We have made some changes to panelboards busses per USPS approval to improve ship dates on pending items.  This should help.  USPS non-stop changes to floor plans and OSL layout.  This is affect work that has already been installed.  We just removed 400 feet of metal stud walls with drywall and electrical rough-in due to changes by USPS.  We have informed them of the impact of these changes from a cost standpoint and schedule impact.  However, USPS still wants us to maintain the original schedule which at this time is realistic.  Based on information submitted from Korte the week of 2/1/23 they now understand the material lead-time issues we are facing.  The Korte team is looking into other options to reduce 26 - 40-week lead-times in attempt to have substantial completion in September 2023., recovery schedule: We are looking into obtaining different electrical item, contacting other vendors on electrical items and possibly making changes to our electrical design to cut down lead-times on electrical items.  Again, this is all self-inflected by USPS's changes from 10/26/22 to 1/27/23.  Korte team is looking into every possible option to help USPS from USPS.",363
